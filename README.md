# Museum-Project
## To Do list:
- modify this file to include your group members information and tasks assigned per each
- modify this file to include any notes on how to use and run the program
- include any features you have added beyond the minimum requirements in a features list

## Organization:
- code folder: contains your main python application code
- sql scripts folder: contains all sql scripts required (database creation and initialization, sql script with query tasks in the handout, etc...)
- database design folder: EERD and relational schema
- optional data folder: has data files that you can sue to load data to your application if you use this optional implementation requirement

## Notes on how to use program
- Guest view will automatically login
- Admin view will use username: 'adm' and password: 'password'
- Data entry view will use username: 'data_entry' and password: 'password'
- You must have the pip module tabulate installed.
- Some tables display very wide, so if you're running through windows command prompt I reccommend disabling wrap text on resize and increasing the screen size buffer width to stop text from going to next line if it exceeds the screen.

## Additional Features/Bonus marks attempted
- Did querys for point 1 bonus mark.
- Added fully custom triggers for delete and updating tables for bonus marks.
- Added access control using SQL commands for bonus marks.
- Added all 3 access levels in the program for bonus mark.
